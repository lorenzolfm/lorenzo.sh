        <h2>Seriously, what the hell else do you need?</h2>
        <p>
            You probably visit portfolios with spinning 3D models and parallax
            everything. You think those 50MB animations showing someone's
            "coding journey" are impressive. You think loading 40 different
            fonts and 200 JavaScript libraries makes a portfolio "interactive."
            Meanwhile, I'm over here building tools that actually matter - like
            helping people escape financial surveillance and government money
            printing. Wrong priorities, motherfucker. Let me show you what a
            real cypherpunk portfolio looks like:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Loads faster than your attention span (and faster than
                government censorship)
            </li>
            <li>Works on every device from iPhone to Gentoo-booted Thinkpad</li>
            <li>
                Actually tells you what I do instead of making you solve
                cryptographic puzzles (sometimes I like to create puzzles tho)
            </li>
            <li>Doesn't phone home to 47 different tracking services</li>
            <li>
                Gets to the fucking point without requiring JavaScript enabled
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>I'm jaonoctus, and I build shit that actually matters.</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a Backend Engineer at <strong>ZBD</strong>, where I wrangle
            Bitcoin and Lightning Network code that actually moves real money
            without asking permission from some suit at a bank. You might need
            to KYC tho, not my rules you stupid fuck. Before that, I've been
            breaking and fixing things in the crypto space since I was a fucking
            kid, back when "web3" wasn't a marketing buzzword and we actually
            cared about decentralization.
