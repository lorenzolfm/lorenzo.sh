        <h3>I'm Lorenzo</h3>
        <p>
            I'm a Backend Engineer at <strong>Bipa</strong>, where I ship code
            that backs a bank and secures people's money. Bipa is Brazil's first
            Bitcoin bank and one of the firsts in the world to integrate with
            the Lightning Network. I'm also a developer advocate at
            <strong>Vinteum</strong>, where I teach developers how Bitcoin and
            other freedom tech works and how they can leverage these
            technologies to build cool shit. I did some years of eletrical
            engineering and computer science, dropped out of both tho. I like to
            understand how things work, but I hate bureaucracy.

            Worked in a research lab at the university, building software and

            know you can just download data from decomissioned weather
            satellites with old TV antennas and cheap radios? This is an image I
            made using real-time data transmitted by a NOAA satellite
