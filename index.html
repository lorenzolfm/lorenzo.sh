    <h2>I'm Lorenzo</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a Backend Engineer at <strong>Bipa</strong>, where I ship code
        that backs a bank and secures people's money. Bipa is Brazil's first
        Bitcoin bank and one of the first in the world to integrate with
        the Lightning Network. I'm also a developer advocate at
        <strong>Vinteum</strong>, where I teach developers how Bitcoin and
        other freedom tech works and how they can leverage these
        technologies to build cool shit. I did some years of electrical
        engineering and computer science, dropped out of both tho. I like to
        understand how things work, but I hate bureaucracy.
